# New Year Countdown

This is a simple countdown timer app built with React. When the app is first loaded, it displays a countdown timer that counts down from 10 seconds. When the timer reaches 0, the app displays a message saying "Happy New Year".

The app uses the framer-motion library to add smooth transitions and animations.
